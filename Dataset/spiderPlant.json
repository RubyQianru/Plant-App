If you're growing your spider plant indoors, you may also want to use artificial light to supplement the natural light available. Spider plants can tolerate low levels of light for short periods of time and even thrive partially in the shade, but excessive shade (less than 4 hours of sunlight) and direct sunlight can eventually cause yellowing of the leaves. Keep the spider plant out of direct, afternoon sunlight."

Remember to always sterilize your tools with isopropyl alcohol to avoid spreading any diseases.\n\nSpider Plant Chlorophytum 'Bonnie' should be pruned once a year in late spring or early summer. Pruning should be light, removing any yellowed or damaged leaves, as well as any long stems that are beginning to droop. It's also a good idea to trim back any long or straggly stems that are not producing any leaves or flowers. Pruning should be done before the plant starts to flower for the year, as this will give the plant enough time to form new growth before the next flowering season."
