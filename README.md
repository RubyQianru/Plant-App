# Plant App
- Plant is a comprehensive product designed to empower users with direct plant monitoring capabilities. The product consists of two integral components: a physical hardware unit that accurately measures soil moisture and temperature, and a user-friendly software application featuring a real-time data display of plant conditions. The primary objective of Plant is to enhance users' ability to proactively monitor their plants' well-being and facilitate optimal growth.

- By combining the physical hardware's precise measurements with the intuitive software interface, Plant provides users with the tools they need to gain deeper insights into their plants' health and create an environment conducive to their flourishing.

- The color changes according to the water level, indicating if the water level is healthy for the current plant. I would need to build a backend database to store healthy water levels of different plants, but so far I keep it hard coded for the next user testing.
